<Note>
  This documentation utilizes an OpenAPI specification to automatically generate
  the API reference sections that follow.

## Welcome

This documentation provides details for the E-commerce Platform API. It allows developers to interact with various platform features like user management, product catalogs, orders, payments, and administrative functions.

The API reference sections are generated using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication using **Bearer Tokens**. You should include the token, obtained after successful login (`/api/v1/auth/login`), in the `Authorization` header of your subsequent requests.

**Example Header:**
`Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`

Publicly accessible endpoints, such as user registration (`/api/v1/auth/register`) or public product listing (`/api/v1/products`), do not require authentication. These are typically marked without a security requirement in the specification.

Authentication requirements are defined within the OpenAPI specification using `securitySchemes` and applied via the `security` field (either globally or per-endpoint):

```json
"components": {
  "securitySchemes": {
    "bearerAuth": {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "bearer",
      "bearerFormat": "JWT",
      "description": "JWT Authentication using Bearer token"
    }
    // ... other schemes like googleOAuth might be defined here
  }
},
"security": [
  // Security requirements applied globally or per path/operation
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
